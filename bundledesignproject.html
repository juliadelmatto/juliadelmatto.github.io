      <h5> Welcome to Laley Island. Following the rumors about a piece of the map hidden here, you wander ashore. You've heard the rumors of Laley, the pirate who spent 5 years stranded on the island before being rescued. Was he alone on the island, and how did he find a piece of the puzzle to the gold beneath the sea? Explore the island by following the link below and return to this page once you've found the secret.</h5>

<h5> Once you find the secret, make sure to make a note of what you've found. You may return to your ship at anytime.</h5>

<h5> Solution: 
	<br>
	At the start of the game you'll find a note, leading you to the top of the nearby mountain. There, you'll find another note leading you to a tree by the beach. Under the tree there is a hammer, and upon returning to the start of the game you can smash the skull to uncover a piece of the map to the gold beneath the sea.

	The puzzle I've created would be in the middle of a larger game, where the player would visit different web pages, each with different kinds of puzzles that would reveal a clue after solving. I'm assuming the player is on a team, and one person could play this puzzle while other go to other locations and try and solve other puzzles. Once all of them have been solved, the player could go to the spot on the map and finish the game.
